# bookstore
The Bookstore is a web application created using MVP. The app displays a list of books, and the user can add a book, remove a selected book. This App is built to learn how to use React and Redux.

## Tools & Technologies

- React
- Redux
- Javascript
- Linters
- npm
- Gitflow


## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Setup

run the following commands in your terminal

```
- git clone https://github.com/julzedz/bookstore.git
- cd bookstore
- git checkout dev
```

### Local deployment

- npm run start - To run the application locally
- Run the browser via `localhost:3000`
- npm run build - To build the application locally

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
